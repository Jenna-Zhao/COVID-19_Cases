This Dashboard mainly focuses on data from [WHO COVID-19 dashboard data](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c). We present some interactive visualizations of the global cumulative cases and deaths by country, as well as new cases and deaths. In addition, we further analyse global trends in new cases or deaths, regional differences in cases or deaths, and correlations between population and cases.

 

<h4>Cumulative Data</h4>
<hr style="margin-top: 0;">

This section features maps that visualize cumulative cases or deaths for selected time periods. Users can interact with the map through various options to adjust the displayed data:

-   **Selecting Data Range:** Users can slide the time bar to select their period of interest;
-   **Type:** Users can toggle between viewing cumulative cases or deaths;
-   **Choose a Country:** Users can select a specific country to view detailed data on cases or deaths during the chosen period.

 

<h4>Incremental Data</h4>
<hr style="margin-top: 0;">

At this section, we track the changes in new cases and deaths over time with line plots in a country. Users can interact with these plots by:

-   **Date:** Users can adjust the time bar to select a time period of interest;
-   **Choose a country:** Users have the option to select either a specific country or global data ("Total"), allowing for flexibility in viewing either detailed or aggregated information.

<span style="color:blue"> *Note:* </span> Due to the large dataset, it may take some time to run the entire visualization.

 

<h4>Analysis</h4>

<hr style="margin-top: 0;">

Three types of statistical analyses are performed on the COVID data in this section. Log transformations are applied in all three analyses to improve the clarity and interpretability of the visualizations:

-   **Worldwide Trends**: Observing changes in new cases or deaths globally;
-   **Regional Differences**: Visualizing differences in COVID-19 cases or deaths by region;
-   **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and population size in various countries.
