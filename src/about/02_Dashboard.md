This Dashboard mainly focuses on data from [WHO COVID-19 dashboard data](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c). We present some interactive visualizations of the global cumulative cases and deaths by country, as well as new cases and deaths. In addition, we further analyse global trends in new cases or deaths, regional differences in cases or deaths, and correlations between population and cases.

 

<h4>Cumulative Data</h4>
<hr style="margin-top: 0;">

This section features maps that visualize cumulative cases or deaths for selected time periods. Users can interact with the map through various options to adjust the displayed data:

-   **Selecting Data Range:** Allows users to choose their period of interest;
-   **Type:** Enables selection between viewing the distribution of cumulative cases or deaths;
-   **Choose a Country:** Provides specific data on cases or deaths for the chosen country during the selected period.

 

<h4>Incremental Data</h4>
<hr style="margin-top: 0;">

At this section, we track the changes in new cases and deaths over time with line plots in a country. Users can interact with these plots by:

-   **Date:** Enables users to choose the time period they are interested in;
-   **Choose a country:** Allows selection for a country or global data, providing flexibility in viewing detailed or aggregated information.

<span style="color:blue"> Note:</span> Due to the large dataset, it may take some time to run the entire visualisation

 

<h4>Analysis</h4>
<hr style="margin-top: 0;">

Three types of statistical analyses are performed on the COVID data in this section. Log transformations are applied in all three analyses to improve the clarity and interpretability of the visualizations:

-   **Worldwide Trends**: Observing changes in new cases or deaths globally;
-   **Regional Differences**: Visualizing differences in COVID-19 cases or deaths by region;
-   **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and population size in various countries.
